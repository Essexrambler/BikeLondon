### Overview
This project was about bringing together the skills we had learnt in one individual project.

###Aim of the project
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
*  A **working game, built by me**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to my hosted working game** in the URL section of my Github repo.
 
### Technology Used
* Javascript
* jQuery
* HMTL5
* CSS3
* Heroku
* git

### Project Feedback + Evaluation
In only having had 2 weeks experience in the technology used it was a big learning curve. This project has taught me lots about how to tackle a web development project.

####Steps I took:
- Planning, timeline, wireframe, gameplay rules, technology to use, etc
- Individually building and testing components. Collision tests, key press control, audio and restricting the movement of the player. Later implementing these into the main game file.
- Staring simple. Adding on game components one at a time. Keeping it simple as I worked towards an MVP.

###Where to from here?
The game could be improved in the following ways:

* Adding on a second player either playing locally or via the internet.
* Adding on more challenges and levels.
* Making the levels harder through addons such as; potholes, pedestrians, rubbish,roadworks, corners in the road etc...
* Add speed via the peddling key presses(z,x keys)
* Timer or race against another player through the level.
* Intergration with music, eg intergrate spotify to keep players on the site longer
* Not just top down view.
